**[Benjamin]:** Welcome everyone to our Q1 planning session for OpenCivics. Today we need to discuss the TrustGraph implementation timeline.

**[Jane]:** Thanks Benjamin. I've been working on the attestation framework. I think we can target end of February for the MVP.

*2024-01-07 14:35:00*

**[Benjamin]:** That sounds good. Jane, can you recruit 10 pilot participants for the expert network by next week?

*2024-01-07 14:36:00*

**[Jane]:** Yes, I'll start reaching out tomorrow. I have a few civic technology contacts who would be perfect.

*2024-01-07 14:38:00*

**[Benjamin]:** Great. I'll draft the technical spec for TrustGraph by January 14th. We should also move our weekly sync to Tuesdays.

*2024-01-07 14:40:00*

**[Jane]:** Tuesdays work for me. Should we invite the governance working group to the next session?

*2024-01-07 14:41:00*

**[Benjamin]:** Good idea. Let's do that. I'll send the calendar invite.
