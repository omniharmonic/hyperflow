# AI Research Team Sync

## Summary

Weekly sync for the AI research team. Discussed progress on the attention mechanism paper and upcoming conference deadlines.

## Transcript

*2026-01-09 14:00:00*

**[Dr. Lisa Chang]:** Welcome everyone to our weekly research sync. Let's start with updates on the attention mechanism paper.

*2026-01-09 14:02:00*

**[Alex Kumar]:** I've completed the ablation studies we discussed last week. The results show a 15% improvement over the baseline.

*2026-01-09 14:04:00*

**[Dr. Lisa Chang]:** Excellent work, Alex! Can you write up the results section by Friday? We need to submit to ICML by the end of the month.

*2026-01-09 14:05:00*

**[Alex Kumar]:** I'll have it ready. Should I also update the related work section to include the new DeepMind paper?

*2026-01-09 14:07:00*

**[Dr. Lisa Chang]:** Yes, please do. Also, Rachel, how's the implementation going for the open-source release?

*2026-01-09 14:08:00*

**[Rachel Nguyen]:** The core modules are done. I'm working on documentation and unit tests now. Should be ready for GitHub release by next Wednesday.

*2026-01-09 14:10:00*

**[Dr. Lisa Chang]:** Great. Make sure to coordinate with the Stanford team - they mentioned wanting to integrate our work with their transformer library.

*2026-01-09 14:12:00*

**[Alex Kumar]:** I spoke with Professor Wei at Stanford last week. They're excited about the collaboration. I'll set up a joint call for next Tuesday.

*2026-01-09 14:14:00*

**[Rachel Nguyen]:** Should we also prepare a demo notebook for the release? That helped a lot with our last paper.

*2026-01-09 14:15:00*

**[Dr. Lisa Chang]:** Absolutely. Rachel, can you create a Colab notebook demonstrating the key features? And Alex, please review it before we publish.

*2026-01-09 14:17:00*

**[Alex Kumar]:** Will do. I'll also add some visualization code to make the attention patterns more intuitive.

*2026-01-09 14:18:00*

**[Dr. Lisa Chang]:** Perfect. Let's reconvene same time next week. Good work everyone!
